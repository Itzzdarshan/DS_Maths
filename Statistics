STATISTICS – Simple Notes

What is Statistics?

Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data so that we can understand information and make decisions.

Statistics is mainly divided into two types:

Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics helps us simplify and summarize large amounts of data.
It tells us what the data looks like.

It does NOT make predictions — it only describes existing data.

Main components of Descriptive Statistics:

1️⃣ Measure of Central Tendency

Mean → Arithmetic average (affected by outliers)
Median → Middle value (robust to outliers)
Mode → Most frequent value

Huge difference → shows presence of outlier.





2️⃣ Measure of Variability (Dispersion)

Shows how spread out the data is.

• Range = Largest value – Smallest value (Range = Maximum value - Minimum value)

• Variance – Average squared deviation from mean

Formula (Population)

Formula (Sample)

Where:

• x = each value
• μ / x̄ = mean
• n = number of values

• Standard Deviation – Square root of variance (same units as data)

Formula
￼
Standard deviation tells us how far data points move away from the mean on average.

Summary

Range → Overall spread
Variance → Squared deviation from mean
Standard Deviation → Actual deviation from mean

High values → Data widely spread
Low values → Data tightly clustered




3️⃣ Distribution Shape / Frequency Distribution

Shows how often values occur.

Common visuals:

• Histogram
• Box Plot
• Pie Chart
• Cumulative Line Chart

These help us understand:

• Data pattern
• Skewness
• Outliers
• Class balance

Why Descriptive Statistics matters in ML:
Descriptive statistics helps us understand data before modeling.
It gives a clear picture of patterns, spread, and anomalies in raw datasets.


Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics uses sample data to draw conclusions about a larger population.

It helps us:

• Make predictions
• Test assumptions
• Measure uncertainty

Key concepts:

Confidence Interval → Range of possible true values (Estimates uncertainty in predictions)
Hypothesis Testing → Decision making using data (Validation of features, models, and experiments)
Regression → Relationship between variables (Foundation of supervised learning)
P-value → Probability of randomness (Smaller P-value = more confident decision)
Z-score → Distance from mean (Formula : Z = (Value − Mean) / Standard Deviation)
