# 📐 Mathematical Foundations for Machine Learning

To build and optimize models, you must understand the "language" they speak. Below is a high-level summary of the three mathematical pillars of Data Science.

### 1. Probability: The Logic of Uncertainty

Machine Learning works with noisy and incomplete data. Probability allows us to measure uncertainty and make informed decisions.

* **Bayes’ Theorem:** The "gold standard" for updating beliefs based on new evidence. It is the core of the Naive Bayes classifier.


* **Distributions:** Data follows patterns. We use **Discrete** (count-based) distributions for classification and **Continuous** (range-based) distributions like the **Normal Distribution** for regression.

### 2. Linear Algebra: The Language of Data

In ML, data is not just numbers; it is structured as **Vectors** (lists) and **Matrices** (grids).

* **Tensors:** High-dimensional data structures used in Deep Learning.
* **Dot Product:** The core operation used to calculate **Weights** (importance of features) and generate predictions.
* **Transpose:** Used to reshape data during complex model calculations.

### 3. Statistics: Summarizing & Inferring

Statistics allows us to turn raw numbers into meaningful insights and validated conclusions.

* **Descriptive Statistics:** Uses **Mean**, **Median**, and **Standard Deviation** to describe what the data looks like and identify outliers.
* **Inferential Statistics:** Uses sample data to make predictions about a larger population through **Hypothesis Testing** and **P-values**.
* **Z-Score:** Measures how far a specific data point is from the average, helping us detect anomalies.
